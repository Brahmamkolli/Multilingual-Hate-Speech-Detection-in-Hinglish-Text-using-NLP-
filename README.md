## Multilingual Hate Speech Detection in Hinglish Text using NLP 
##  Project Overview
# 1.Business problem Understanding

## 📂 Dataset
- Dataset used: Hinglish / Multilingual hate speech dataset (text in mixed Hindi-English).
- Dataset references / file mentions found in notebook:
  - `# Prediction on New Data`
  - `**Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)**`
  - `# 3.Data Cleaning`

## ⚙️ Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to reproduce preprocessing, training, and evaluation steps:
```bash
jupyter notebook "Multilingual Hate Speech Detection in Hinglish Text using NLP .ipynb"
```

## 🧠 Model & Methods
- Text preprocessing: tokenization, cleaning, (possibly transliteration/normalization for Hinglish).
- Feature extraction: TF-IDF / CountVectorizer or transformer tokenizers if used.
- Classifiers: sklearn-based classifiers or transformer-based fine-tuning (BERT / multilingual models) depending on notebook.

## 📊 Evaluation
- Evaluation metrics used in the notebook include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 🔮 Future Work
- Increase dataset size and class balance.
- Experiment with multilingual transformer models (e.g., mBERT, XLM-R) and data augmentation.
- Deploy as an API for inference on streaming text.
